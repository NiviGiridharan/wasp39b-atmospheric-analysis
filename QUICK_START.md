## Action Items (Do These NOW)

### 1. Customize Files (5 minutes)

**Edit CONTRIBUTORS.md:**
- Replace `[Your Name]` with your actual name
- Replace `[Ema's Name]` with your teammate's name  
- Add your GitHub usernames and emails
- Update university name and semester

**Edit README.md:**
- Scroll to bottom "Contact" section
- Add your name, email, LinkedIn, portfolio website

### 2. Push to GitHub (10 minutes)

**Follow GIT_SETUP.md step-by-step:**
1. Create new GitHub repository called `wasp39b-atmospheric-analysis`
2. Navigate to this folder in terminal
3. Run these commands:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: WASP-39b atmospheric analysis"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wasp39b-atmospheric-analysis.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### 3. Update Your Resume (2 minutes)

**Your current resume says:**
> Processed JWST FITS data with Python (Astropy, NumPy, Matplotlib), applying Savitzky–Golay filtering, binning, and residual analysis to extract spectra. Modeled atmospheric absorption and applied Bayesian inference with MCMC (emcee) to estimate temperature and molecular abundances (CO2, H2O, CH4)

**Add this line:**
> **GitHub**: [github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wasp39b-atmospheric-analysis](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wasp39b-atmospheric-analysis)

### 4. Enhance Your Profile (Optional, 10 minutes)

**After pushing to GitHub:**
1. Pin this repository on your GitHub profile
2. Add topics/tags: `exoplanets`, `jwst`, `mcmc`, `bayesian-inference`, `astropy`
3. Take screenshots of key plots from notebook
4. Add 2-3 images to README for visual appeal

## What Makes This Repository Strong

✅ **Matches your resume exactly** - No inconsistencies  
✅ **Shows advanced techniques** - MCMC, Bayesian inference, spectroscopy  
✅ **Professional documentation** - Clear README, setup instructions  
✅ **Real scientific data** - JWST observations of actual exoplanet  
✅ **Reproducible** - Clear data source and installation steps  

## Common Questions

**Q: Should I include the FITS data files?**  
A: No! They're too large (GB). The .gitignore already excludes them. README explains how to download.

**Q: What about the Ganymede/Titan code I showed you earlier?**  
A: Don't include it. Not on your resume, not in final project. Keep GitHub focused.

**Q: Can recruiters run this code?**  
A: Yes! They can download JWST data following data/README.md instructions. But most will just read the README and notebook.

**Q: Should this be public or private?**  
A: **Public** for portfolio. If you're nervous, start private and make public later.

**Q: Do I need to mention it was a course project?**  
A: Yes, it's in README. This is honest and expected for master's students. Shows you can handle real-world data problems.
