## Acknowledgments

This was originally a collaborative course project. Special thanks to my teammate for their contributions to the initial analysis and data processing work.

**Course**: Projects in Data Science  
**Institution**: Florida State University  
**Semester**: 3  
**Motivation**: Inspired by the Europa Clipper mission and the search for habitable worlds

## Project Evolution

We iterated through multiple project ideas before settling on WASP-39b:
1. Initial proposal: Surface analysis of Ganymede and Titan
2. Decision to pivot: More sophisticated spectroscopic analysis
3. Final focus: Exoplanet atmospheric characterization

The decision to focus on atmospheric spectroscopy rather than surface imaging allowed us to demonstrate more advanced statistical techniques (MCMC, Bayesian inference) relevant to data science.

## Technical Contributions
